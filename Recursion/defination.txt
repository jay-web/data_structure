* - It is the function which called itself.
* - It invoke itself with different input until it reach its base point or case.
* - Base case is the point where recursion ends like while loop

* - So two essential requirements for recursion
    - One is base case
    - Second is different input

* - Helper method recursion
    - Here, we create the function which will be normal function 
    - Inside, normal function we will create another function which we use as recursion function

* - Tips
    - For arrays, use methods like slice, the spread operator, and concat that make copies 
    - of arrays so you do not mutate them

    - String are immutable so you need to use methods like slice, substr or substring to 
        to make copies of strings
