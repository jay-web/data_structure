// Selection Sort

Selection sort will store the first index as per iteration, as lowest value index
Then start the iteration, if it find any new lowest value then it swap it's index with the store one.
and after first iteration in array, if lowest value changed while iteration, 
then it swap the value in array with the first index to the lowest one.

Big(O) of selection sort is - n^2 (because of the nested looping)
