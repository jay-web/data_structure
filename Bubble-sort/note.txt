// * Bubble Sort

Big O - Due to nested loop, bubble sort BIG(O) is n^2 

Note - we can converted into log(n) which means linear, if we inserted almost sorted array in that
    where we need implement noSwap method to stop the iteration after first iteration
    But it will applicable on single value sorting

But- best way is to use different sorting algo instead of noswap in bubble sort
