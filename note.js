// * This data structure contains nodes, which carry value and a pointer of next node or null.
// * It is data structure that contain head, tail and length property.
// * It is without index value to access any particular value like normal array.
// * Insertion and deletion are expensive in normal array than the linked list.

// ? What is node?
